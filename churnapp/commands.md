General notes
Use Anaconda Python to create an environment and test your code
Use Anaconda Power Shell Prompt to create docker container
Uninstall all Python packages in Windows
pip freeze | % {pip uninstall -y $_}
Build the container
Make sure docker desktop is running
 docker build -t housing_fall25 .
Run the container
docker run -d --name housing_fall25_deployed -p 8002:80 housing_fall25
Stop and Remove Container to Rebuild
docker stop housing_fall25_deployed
docker rm housing_fall25_deployed
docker image rm housing_fall25
To push a Docker image to Docker Hub, follow these steps:

1. Log in to Docker Hub
Before pushing an image, you need to log in to your Docker Hub account:

docker login
Enter your Docker Hub username and password when prompted.
2. Tag the Image
Docker Hub requires images to be tagged with your Docker Hub username and repository name. Use the following command to tag your image:

docker tag housing_fall25:latest mkzia/housing_fall25:v1
Replace <image_name> with the name of your local image.
Replace <tag> with the version tag (e.g., latest or v1.0).
Replace <dockerhub_username> with your Docker Hub username.
Replace <repository_name> with the name of the repository on Docker Hub.
Example: If your local image is named housing_fall25:latest and your Docker Hub username is john_doe, tag it like this:

docker tag housing_fall25:latest john_doe/housing_fall25:v1
3. Push the Image
Once the image is tagged, push it to Docker Hub using the following command:

docker push <dockerhub_username>/<repository_name>:<tag>
Example:

docker push john_doe/myapp:latest
4. Verify the Image on Docker Hub
After the push is complete, you can verify the image by logging into your Docker Hub account and checking the repository.

Full Example Workflow
Build the Docker image:
docker build -t myapp:latest .
Tag the image:
docker tag myapp:latest john_doe/myapp:latest
Log in to Docker Hub:
docker login
Push the image:
docker push john_doe/myapp:latest
